# PyTorch notes

This repo represents a potpourri of notes I've taken during my journey learning pytorch. As I haven't been using pytorch for a while now, writing my notes in markdowns and executing code in parallel has helped get up to speed very quickly.

The different resources I've used to learn pytorch over time are:

- [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-pytorch): This book is a great resource for any one that has a basic grasp of deep learning algorithms or who's coming from tensorflow. It's a bit similar to [Deep Learning with Python](https://fchollet.com/) that uses Keras.
- [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188): This is a free course offered on Udacity with collaboration with Facebook
- [Yann LeCun's Deep Learning Course](https://cds.nyu.edu/deep-learning/): This course was an opportunity for me to brush up on my deep learning knowledge and to get some good practice with PyTorch

The notes I'd taken over time are, as a result, just a summary of what I've learnt in from the above resources and some blog posts. Thanks to everyone who has contributed to my knowledge.
